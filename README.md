# Smart Home Lipo Discharger 


This is quad Lipo Discharger with Apple Home Kit integration. No matter if you plug 3s, 4s or 6s lipos, the lipos will be discharged to ~25%-35% which translates in around 3.75V per cell. Once the discharge "percentage" is reached, a push message will be send to the phone.

# General information about the used HomeKit devices

Basiscally the code creates 9 Apple HomeKit deivces that can be paired with your HomeKit  homekit. YTH 9 devices? 

According to my understandig / research: 
1.  the only devices that can display 2 digit values which won't be round up to ".5" are temperature sensors
2.  the only devices that can display percentages are humidity sensors

For a quad port lipo discharger this means that for each lipo **1x temperature** sensor and ++1x humidity sensor** is needed to display the voltage level and the discharge percentage. Additionally one temperature sensor for reading the surface temperature will be created - makes 9 devices...

Why is the percentage used instead just the voltage?
For displaying the status bar on the ESP32 display and for creating HomeKit automations, it's much easier to use the percentage instead of the voltage. Because voltage levels differ between 3s,4s and 6s lipos you can simply automate it with "if percentage drops below 20% then......."

# How to setup the ESP32

1. Wire the hardware as described in the wiring_diagram.pdf (do this at your own risk)
2. Upload the sketch / code to your ESP32.
3. Done

If you want to use of the HomeKit integration:

1. Open the COM/serial port via any terminal program or use the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor
2. Configure your WLAN settings via the "homespan" CLI. Homespan comes with it's own CLI which can be used via a regular serial interface. simply type in "W" in the terminal and follow the on-screen instructions. More information can be found here: https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/blob/master/docs/CLI.md
3. check the boot process in the serial monitor (check for errors)
4. Open the HomeKit APP on your iPhone/iPad/Apple TV to pair the new device(s). Use my default pairing code "11112222" or the homespan default pairing code "46637726". The code can be changed in the setup routine.

# How to setup the HomeKit automation and push messages

Because Apple HomeKit and siri shortcuts doesn't support push messages natively, you need to use a 3rd party app. Simple push messages can be easily generated by using "webhooks". For me IFTTT works perfectly fine,- with a free account you can use up to 4 "applets" but for push messages you only need one. Simply download the APP, register, add the "webhook extension" and follow the instructions: 

## Setup IFTTT and generate the "webhook" URL

Finally copy the webhook URL (last sceenshot) and replace {event} with the **EventName** you entered in the first step. In this example this would be "LipoStatus" and the resulting URL looks like this:

https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/LipoStatus/with/key/dmwULjHgx7ICAB6ozADFD


Note that the URL contains **your personal key** (last section of the URL). This means that everyone that got your URL, can trigger push messages on your phone.

Finally, test it. Simply copy the URL into the browser and check if you receive a push message. If all works fine, HomeKit automations can use this URL to trigger push message. I know, could be much easier but apple.............
